### Project Description 
- a robot car controlled using web browser. 
### Parts
   - Raspberry Pi with WiFi 
   - Chassis Rectangle 4WD with motors 
   - Motor Driver L298D
   
### Connections
Raspberry Pi controls the servos via the PWM module and the driver by setting the pins on the H-bridge and providing PWM signal
  
  #### Schematic:

   controllerâ€™s outputs are connected to the H-bridge, and the PWM signal is used to set the speed of the motors. 
   The RPi-pins are also connected to the H-bridge. 
   The states on the appropriate pins will determine the direction of rotation of the motors. 
   
### below are some illustrative photos of the whole car
